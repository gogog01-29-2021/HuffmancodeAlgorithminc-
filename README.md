# 250312 Algorithm Java Jaheekim (C++ Refactored)

This repository contains C++ refactored versions of various algorithm/data structure projects originally written in Java. Each subfolder ending with `_c++` contains a C++ implementation, a Makefile, and a README for building and running the code.

## Subfolders
- `250324Huffmancode_c++`: Huffman coding (bottom-up, robust, with code printing)
- `250315_c++`: Simple undirected graph and BFS path finder
- `DSweek2_c++`: Student, Node, and related algorithms
- `basicGraph_c++`: Multiple graph representations (adjacency list, matrix, incidence matrix)
- `huffman_c++`: Huffman tree and decoder (tree structure focus)
- `TST_c++`: Ternary Search Tree (TST) and search utility

## How to Build and Run
Each subfolder contains its own `README.md` and `Makefile` with detailed instructions. In general, you can:

1. `cd` into the desired subfolder (e.g., `cd 250324Huffmancode_c++`)
2. Run `make` to build the project
3. Run the resulting executable (e.g., `./HuffmanCode`)

For more details, see the `README.md` in each subfolder.
